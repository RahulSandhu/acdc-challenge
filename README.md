# ACDC Radiomics Challenge

This repository contains all the code, data, and results for a radiomics-based
classification challenge using the ACDC dataset. We developed and evaluated
several machine learning models (ANN, KNN, RF, SVM) for multi-class
classification of cardiac pathologies using radiomic features extracted from
cardiac MRI images.

## 🖥️ Code

- `code/eda/`: Exploratory Data Analysis scripts
- `code/models/`: Machine learning model definitions (ANN, KNN, RF, SVM)
- `code/metrics/`: Custom metrics and evaluation functions
- `code/utils/`: Utility functions (e.g., Lasso feature selection, parsing best
parameters)

## 📁 Data

- `data/datasets/`
  - `norm_acdc_radiomics.csv`: Normalized dataset used for model training and
  validation
  - `raw_acdc_radiomics.csv`: Raw extracted radiomics features
- `data/simple/`
  - `X_train_norm.csv`, `X_train_raw.csv`, ..., `y_val_norm.csv`,
  `y_val_raw.csv`
- `data/kfold/`
  - `X_temp_norm.csv`, `X_test_norm.csv`, `y_temp_norm.csv`, `y_test_norm.csv`

## 📊 Results

- `results/models/`: Trained models saved as `.pkl` files
- `results/metrics/`: Classification reports (CSV and TXT) for each model under
simple and k-fold settings

## 📈 Figures

All generated figures for EDA, feature selection, model training, and
evaluations are stored under the `images/` directory:

- EDA visualizations (BMI, multicollinearity, outliers, etc.)
- Feature selection curves (MSE vs lambda/threshold)
- Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Hyperparameter tuning visualizations
- Overall workflow schemas
